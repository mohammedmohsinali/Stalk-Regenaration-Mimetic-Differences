Marine Algae Stalk Ca^2+ Regeneration  Using Mimetic Differences

In this study, we delve into the complex interplay of chemical reactions and diffusion processes that
underpin whorl formation in marine algae, focusing specifically on the influence of external calcium
concentrations. At the heart of our investigation is the application of the mimetic operators MOLE
library, a sophisticated numerical tool designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with high
accuracy and efficiency. Through this computational lens, we elucidate the dynamic changes in marine
algae whorl formation, shedding light on the critical role of calcium in mediating these processes. Our
findings not only advance the understanding of marine algaeâ€™s physiological responses to environmental
stimuli but also demonstrate the utility of the MOLE library in tackling complex biochemical systems.
This research contributes valuable insights into the reaction-diffusion mechanisms governing biological
pattern formation, with potential implications for broader ecological and environmental studies
